      <description>Multiple choice question in which respondent can select more than one correct answer from the list is a usual part of almost every survey.
It is usually visualized as a simple bar chart ignoring the overlap between the different categories, while this overlap can bring more analytical value and depth to the analysis.
Euler diagram is a perfect way to show the relationship between different subsets and that’s hardly possible to build it with the commonly used spreadsheet software such as MS Excel.</description>

It became recently a quite popular approach to bring a storytelling elements within a longitudinal dataset. Readers are suggested to connect and combine what they see on the chart with other qualitive elements that they know about (elements of history). By using the allegory of F1 Race, it gives a very dynamic dimension.</description>
