      <description>What is Conjoint analysis? Conjoint analysis originated in mathematical psychology by psychometricians and was developed since the mid-sixties also by researchers in marketing and business. Conjoint analysis (CA) is often used to evaluate how people make decisions between a set of different options when considering a number of criteria at the same time (conjoint features; “trade-offs”). Rather than rating the importance of each attribute separately, participants rate their preferences for profiles or products with different combinations of the attributes or criteria.</description>

      <title>Using Analytic Hierarchy Process to weight vulnerability scorecard</title>

      <description>Problem Statement: Defining vulnerabilities scorecard weights through expert judgment In humanitarian contexts, it’s not always possible to use a statistically representative dataset in order to infer the relative weights to be used for each criteria from the full vulnerability scorecard. The only options is to use multiple expert judgement in order to Define relative weights to be used for each criteria .
Often teams of expert suffer from non-aligned goals, power politics, group dynamics and lack of mutual understanding, which comes though with specific challenges:</description>

      <title>A practical implementation of deprivation model: index of protection risks</title>

      <description>This example is based on the note: A new index of refugee protection and presents the construction of a lack-of-protection index (or “index of protection risks”) constructed from two sub-dimensions: safety problems (18 indicators) and movement restrictions (6 indicators). To feel safe and secure in one’s home and surroundings is one of the core aspects of humanitarian protection, as is the freedom of movement.
The Limitation of measurement based on incident analysis It is tempting to build measures of protection or of the lack thereof from counts of incident sand of other reported events for populations at risk.</description>

      <title>Building Severity Index with R</title>

      <description>In this tutorial, We will see how to build a severity index using a key informant interview dataset. Building such index, also called composite indicator, is among the regular and expected task of any humanitarian data analyst.The objective is to summarize information into a simple indicator that can reduce information overflow. Severity index informs the sectoral and inter-sectoral discussions taking place as part of the Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) process, in particular facilitating a comparison of needs across geographic areas.</description>
