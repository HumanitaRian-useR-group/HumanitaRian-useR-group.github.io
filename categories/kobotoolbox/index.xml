      <description>Multiple choice question in which respondent can select more than one correct answer from the list is a usual part of almost every survey.
It is usually visualized as a simple bar chart ignoring the overlap between the different categories, while this overlap can bring more analytical value and depth to the analysis. 
Euler diagram is a perfect way to show the relationship between different subsets and that’s hardly possible to build it with the commonly used spreadsheet software such as MS Excel.</description>
